# Digital-Circuit-Logic-Practice
A practice project in circuit logic using MML (multimedia logic). The program demonstrates key pad inputs, 8 segment LEDS read and write registers, 2 to 4 and 4 to 1 multiplexors, update and clear register buttons, and more. Clear instructions and comments within the file show its full functionality, and best serves as a demo of my circuit logic design knowledge.
